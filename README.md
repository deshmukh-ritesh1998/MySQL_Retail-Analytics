# 🛍️ Retail Analytics Case Study (MySQL)

This project showcases a comprehensive **Retail Analytics Case Study** using MySQL, demonstrating the ability to work with real-world business data to extract meaningful insights, support strategic decision-making, and drive data-informed customer engagement and product optimization.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

This project was designed to simulate a real-world retail business scenario with the following goals:

- 🧹 Clean and preprocess raw data from sales, customer, and product databases
- 📊 Perform **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers
- 💰 Calculate **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** to identify and retain high-value customers
- 🛒 Analyze **top-performing products** and optimize inventory strategy
- 👥 Apply **demographic segmentation** to identify spending patterns across age and gender

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The analysis uses three core datasets representing typical retail business operations:

- `customer_profiles`: Contains demographics such as age, gender, and location
- `product_inventory`: Includes product names, categories, and pricing
- `sales_transaction`: Tracks purchase dates, quantities, and customer-product relationships

---

## 🔧 Techniques & Concepts Applied

The following SQL techniques were applied to clean, process, and analyze the data:

- Data Cleaning using `ALTER TABLE`, `UPDATE`, and data type conversions
- Date standardization using `STR_TO_DATE()`
- Analytical SQL with:
- Window Functions (`NTILE()`, `RANK()`)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Conditional logic (`CASE`)
- Aggregate Functions (`SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `ROUND()`)

These helped simulate tasks expected in real-world data analyst roles.
