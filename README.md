# Retail Analytics Case Study (MySQL)

This project showcases a comprehensive **Retail Analytics Case Study** using MySQL, demonstrating the ability to work with real-world business data to extract meaningful insights, support strategic decision-making, and drive data-informed customer engagement and product optimization.


# Project Objectives

This project was designed to simulate a real-world retail business scenario with the following goals:

- Clean and preprocess raw data from sales, customer, and product databases
- Perform **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers
- Calculate **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** to identify and retain high-value customers
- Analyze **top-performing products** and optimize inventory strategy
- Apply **demographic segmentation** to identify spending patterns across age and gender


# Dataset Overview

The analysis uses three core datasets representing typical retail business operations:

- `customer_profiles`: Contains demographics such as age, gender, and location
- `product_inventory`: Includes product names, categories, and pricing
- `sales_transaction`: Tracks purchase dates, quantities, and customer-product relationships


# Techniques & Concepts Applied

The following SQL techniques were applied to clean, process, and analyze the data:

- Data Cleaning using `ALTER TABLE`, `UPDATE`, and data type conversions
- Date standardization using `STR_TO_DATE()`
- Analytical SQL with:
- Window Functions (`NTILE()`, `RANK()`)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Conditional logic (`CASE`)
- Aggregate Functions (`SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `ROUND()`)

These helped simulate tasks expected in real-world data analyst roles.


# Key Business Insights

- **Top 10 Customers** contributed 22% of overall revenue — strong candidates for loyalty programs
- **Women aged 36–60** spend 40% more than male counterparts — strong segment for targeted campaigns
- **Three best-selling products** accounted for over 35% of revenue — inventory should prioritize these
- Identified a segment of **“At-Risk” customers** who have not purchased recently — potential re-engagement opportunity


# Actionable Recommendations

Based on the insights gained:

-  Launch loyalty programs targeting **Top CLV customers**
-  Create reactivation email campaigns for **At-Risk segments**
-  Adjust inventory planning to match demand for **high-revenue products**
-  Use demographic data to guide **personalized marketing strategies**


# Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL 8.0+** — core database for analysis
- **MySQL Workbench** / **InnoDB** — for query writing and data visualization
- Markdown — for documentation and GitHub portfolio presentation


# Why This Project Matters?

This project reflects real business challenges where data analysts must:

- Work with **imperfect data**
- Translate raw data into **business insights**
- Provide **strategic recommendations**
- Communicate findings clearly to stakeholders


# Let’s Connect

I'm always eager to discuss about data analytics and opportunities to contribute to impactful business insights.
